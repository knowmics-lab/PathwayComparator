# PACO (PAthway COmparator)
Shiny R web-app for comparing perturbed pathways associated to different phenotypes.

<b>URL:</b>
<a href="https://alpha.dmi.unict.it/shiny/users/gmicale/PathwayComparator/">https://alpha.dmi.unict.it/shiny/users/gmicale/PathwayComparator/</a>.

<b>Input data:</b>

Three types of text files can be uploaded by the user for pathway comparison:
- Custom file
- MITHrIL perturbation file
- PHENSIM simulation file

Example files are available in the "Data" folder.

Currently supported organisms:
- Human
- Mouse
- Rat

More organisms will be supported in the future.

<br/>

<b>Custom file:</b>

The user can provide the app with any custom text file containing a score for each biological element.
The first line of the text file must contain the common name of one of the supported organisms (e.g. 'Human', 'Mouse') to which biological elements belong. 
The following lines indicate for each biological entity (gene, miRNAs, compound) a perturbation score.
Nodes are referred to by the id of the corresponding biological element, which must be: 
- The Entrez ID for genes
- The miRBase entry name for miRNAs
- The ChEBI id, the KEGG COMPOUND id or the KEGG GLYCAN id for chemical compounds
- The KEGG DRUG id for drugs
Perturbation score can be any real number (positive, negative or zero).

Example:

<pre>
Human
6197	-3.74
6196	0
hsa-miR-199b-3p	0
hsa-miR-128-3p	2.5
hsa-miR-214-3p	0
chebi:43474	0
</pre>

<b>MITHrIL perturbation file:</b>

MITHrIL evaluate the de-regulation of pathways due to expression changes of one or more pathway elements. MITHrIL requires a list of biological entities with their log-fold expression changes as input. De-regulation of pathway nodes is measured by a perturbation score, which can be positive or negative.

MITHril is available as a command line tool (<a href="https://github.com/alaimos/mithril-standalone">https://github.com/alaimos/mithril-standalone</a>), and its output is a perturbation file that can be directly uploaded as input to PACO. The scores associated with nodes and used by PACO are the values of the "Perturbation" column.

Example:

<pre>
# Pathway Id	Pathway Name	Gene Id	Gene Name	Perturbation	Accumulator	pValue
path:hsa00190	Oxidative phosphorylation - Enriched	64077	LHPP	0.45	1.36	1.0
path:hsa00190	Oxidative phosphorylation - Enriched	5464	PPA1	2.10	3.56	1.0
path:hsa00190	Oxidative phosphorylation - Enriched	hsa-miR-101-3p	hsa-miR-101-3p	-0.79	-2.45	1.0
</pre>

<b>PHENSIM simulation file:</b>

PHENSIM (PHENotype SIMulator) (<a href="https://phensim.tech/">https://phensim.tech/</a>) is a tool developed to simulate the de-regulation of pathways biological elements, as a result of the over- or under-expression of user-specified molecules (e.g. genes or miRNAs).

De-regulation of pathway nodes is measured by an activity score, which can be positive or negative, denoting a biological element which is more or less active than normal condition.

After a new simulation has been launched and completed, PHENSIM simulation file can be downloaded as follows:
- Go to the "Simulations" panel on the left sidebar
- Click on "Show simulation" ('eye' icon on the right) to view more details about the simulation
- Go to the "Download results" box at the bottom of the page and click on "Download raw results"

PHENSIM can be also executed from command line as a service of MITHril algorithm (<a href="https://github.com/alaimos/mithril-standalone">https://github.com/alaimos/mithril-standalone</a>).

Scores associated to nodes are the values of "Activity Score" column.

Example:

<pre>
